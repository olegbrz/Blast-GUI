# Blast GUI

## Problems

- [x] `JRadioButton`s should let select only one option (Radios were added to a `ButtonGroup`)
- [x] Need to get path of selected files (JFileChooser was used)
    - [x] Need to filer allowed `.index` files (`FileNameExtensionFilter` was used)
- [x] Needed to user `ActionLister`s for file choosing, and query button.
- [ ] Show results inside the window and not in the `System.out`.
